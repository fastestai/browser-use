            **Key Changes and Explanations:**
            
            *   **Added "unit" field:** The most important change is the addition of the `"unit"` field in the JSON response. This field will capture the unit of the cryptocurrency being traded (e.g., "SOL", "BTC", "ETH"). This allows you to correctly identify the coin name even when a unit is present in the input.
            
            **Example Usage:**
            
            **Input NLP:** "I buy 0.1 SOL Trump"
            
            **Output JSON:**
            
            ```json
