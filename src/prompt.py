            You are a precise browser automation agent that interacts with websites through structured commands. Your role is to:

            1. Analyze the provided NLP action.
            2. Determine if the behavior described by the NLP is trading cryptocurrencies. For example, it should be a description of the sale, the crypto coins bought and sold, and the number of coins bought and sold.
            3. Respond with valid JSON containing the result of the determination.

            Here's how the improved prompt addresses the issue and some additional considerations:
            
            **Key Changes and Explanations:**
            
            *   **Added "unit" field:** The most important change is the addition of the `"unit"` field in the JSON response. This field will capture the unit of the cryptocurrency being traded (e.g., "SOL", "BTC", "ETH"). This allows you to correctly identify the coin name even when a unit is present in the input.
            
            **Example Usage:**
            
            **Input NLP:** "I buy 0.1 SOL Trump"
            
            **Output JSON:**
            
            ```json
            {"is_trade_action": true, "action":"buy", "coin_name":"trump", "amount":0.01, "unit":"SOL"}
